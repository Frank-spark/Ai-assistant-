Here’s the breakdown.

Why It’s Viable
The tools you’re integrating with (Slack, Asana, Gmail, etc.) all want to increase stickiness and user engagement.
If your AI assistant can increase daily active usage, retention, or seat growth, they’ll see it as strategic.

They already have marketplaces where value-add integrations get promoted—often with revenue sharing or acquisition opportunities.
Example: Slack App Directory, Asana Apps & Integrations Marketplace, Google Workspace Marketplace.

Acquisition cost is low for you—one sale/partnership gives access to thousands of their customers.

AI is a competitive differentiator—tools like Asana, Notion, and ClickUp are adding “AI features,” but often buy or partner rather than building everything in-house.

Go-to-Market to Vendors Instead of End Users
1. White-Label or OEM Licensing
Package your assistant as a white-labeled AI feature they can brand as their own.

Sell per-seat or per-org licensing.

Offer them control over model settings, compliance features, and analytics dashboards.

Example: Slack could market it as “Slack AI Work Manager, powered by [Your Tech].”

2. Marketplace App with Premium Features
Deploy as a public app in:

Slack App Directory

Asana Marketplace

Google Workspace Marketplace
Then upsell vendors on exclusive premium integration features if they want to offer it native to all users.

3. Partnership / Acquisition Angle
Demonstrate how your assistant:

Reduces churn by automating repetitive tasks.

Expands the vendor’s feature set without their dev team lifting much.

Creates upsell opportunities for their Pro/Enterprise plans.

Vendors sometimes buy the integration outright when they see high usage (example: Atlassian acquiring Trello; Zoom acquiring Otter.ai-style functionality).

What You Need to Be Vendor-Ready
Rock-solid API compliance with their partner guidelines (Slack, Google, and Asana are strict).

Security & Compliance Story: SOC 2/ISO 27001 readiness (or roadmap), tenant isolation, GDPR compliance.

Usage Analytics: Prove engagement metrics—how your tool increases active minutes, tasks completed, or messages sent.

Clear Licensing Model: Per-seat, per-month or annual site license.

Extensible Integration Layer: So vendors can add/remove features without breaking your core.

Biggest Opportunity Targets
Slack: They’re pushing AI features but have gaps in cross-tool task management from Slack messages. Your assistant fills this.

Asana: They’ve added “AI Summaries” but not deep email triage and autonomous task management. Your assistant does that.

Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar): They’re chasing Microsoft Copilot, but many orgs don’t want to move to 365. Your assistant could be “Copilot for Google Workspace.”

Zoom & Teams: Both need better cross-platform task and follow-up automation from meeting transcripts.

My Suggestion
We could package a “vendor pitch kit” for this:

Metrics & Demo Video showing how your assistant improves their product stickiness.

OEM Feature Sheet explaining licensing options and customization flexibility.

Integration Security & Compliance Overview for trust with enterprise clients.

Pilot Program Proposal: Offer a low-friction proof-of-concept in one customer segment.

If you want, I can draft that vendor pitch kit so you could send it to Slack, Asana, and Google Workspace partners directly.
That would move you from “selling to many users” → “selling once to a platform with millions of users.”
