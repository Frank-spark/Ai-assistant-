# Document for Cursor AI: Positioning the Reflex AI Assistant as a Premium Executive Tool

## Intent Overview

We are positioning the Reflex AI Assistant as a **premium solution** specifically designed for executive-level users. The target audience is CEOs and senior leaders who are looking to improve their company culture and enhance workplace well-being from the top down.

## Key Messaging Points

* **Unique Positioning:** Unlike standard productivity tools, Reflex AI is aimed at executives who want to transform their organizations into great places to work and live.
* **Cultural Impact:** Emphasize that this tool is about more than just efficiency; it’s about helping leaders create a positive, empathetic, and engaging workplace.
* **Executive-Level Focus:** Highlight that the assistant is tailored for high-level strategic users rather than mid-tier or general staff, making it a specialized premium offering.

## README Modification Outline

1. **Introduction Section:**
   Update the intro to clearly state that Reflex AI is a premium AI assistant designed for executive leaders who want to reshape company culture.

2. **Features Section:**
   Add a subsection emphasizing features that support executive goals—context awareness, cultural insights, and leadership dashboards.

3. **Audience Section:**
   Specify that the primary audience is C-level executives and senior leaders who are looking for tools to help them lead more effectively and compassionately.

4. **Value Proposition:**
   Clearly articulate that this is not just another productivity assistant, but a strategic partner for transforming the workplace from the executive level.
